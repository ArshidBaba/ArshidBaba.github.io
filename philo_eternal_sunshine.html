        <h1>Philosophy of <i>Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind</i></h1>
    </a>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I was wondering what the philosophy of the movie <a

            target="_blank"><b>Eternal
                Sunshine of The Spotless Mind</b></a> is?
        I cam across <a
            href="https://philarchive.org/archive/GRAESO#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20experi%2D%20ence%20machine.%E2%80%9D&text=One%20way%20to%20think%20about,have%20retained%20in%20your%20memory."
            target="_blank">this</a> paper by the philosopher <a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CHRISTOPHER+GRAU&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
            target="_blank"><i>Christopher Grau</i></a>, who argues that the movie holds the view that the memory wiping
        machine is harmful to the person who is using it and by harmful he does not mean brain damaging. By harmful
        means that the person who uses that procedure on themself has a less accurate model of reality in their heads.
        He invokes philosphers like Kant, Murdoch, Nagel and others to convince the reader about his position. I found
        the arguments interesting as I myself hold the same view. The other character Mary who works for the clinic
        sends the records of every patient that has ever had the procedure done to them. The movie does hold the view
        that it is not moral to wipe memories, experiences and people from their lives. What I didn't find in the paper
        is the philosophy
        about love and relationships, which the movie says a lot about as the main characters Joel and Clementine decide
        to give a second go to their romance knowing that it might meet the same fate as before.
