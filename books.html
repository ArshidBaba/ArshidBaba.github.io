            <u>The Information By James Gleick:</u><br>
            The books subtext reads A history, a theory, a flood. The author first tells about the history of communication techonlogies and then takes the reader through the development of Information Theory and then cut to current times which the author calls 'after the flood'. I had never seen so many names of scientists from different fields in a single book. The book connects biology, physics, psychology and other fields with Information Theory and lightly suggests that most sciences are information sciences basically. I had fun reading this and gave me a good perspective about the information theory. I read about mant scientists that I already know of and admire and also read about other brilliant scientists that I had no idea existed. A really well written piece.

            <u>Guns Germs And Steel:</u><br>
            This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. This book was an experience. The book was published
            in year 1997 when I was in kindergarten. This book would not have been available in Kashmir at that time. A boy 
            born in Reshan Har Nawa Kadal a downtown area in Srinagar, an under developed area, this thought alone makes me feel grateful
            that I got to read this book. Apart from that this book answered many questions that I had from past 10 or so years.
            Every time I tried to find something about why races are different and why different civilisations are at different
            levels of development my search results would contain Charles Murray's racist rhetoric about how white race is superior. So this book is 
            really important to me.

            <u>Animal Farm by George Orwell:</u><br>
            This book was funny as well as deep. My brother told me that it was drawing parallels with russian 
            revolution. I also think that it was about how power corrupts the soul. It was either way a good read.

            <u>Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman:</u><br>
            I have been wanting to learn physics really deeply and my head I have already started the journey. 
            I need to finish some unfinished business first then I will learn as much as possible. With this book I learned 
            the general picture of physics. Even though I had read some popular physics books before with this I decided I 
            will go into physics formally or unformally. This book has 6 chapters and it starts from atoms and reaches to 
            gravitation in the 5th and finishes with quantum mechanics. I really enjoyed this book a lot

            <u>The Stranger by Albert Camus:</u><br>
            This is among Camus' earliest work. It was not like anything that I had read before.
            The protagnist was a nihilist and didn't have any motivation to do anything and didn't care for anything.
            At first I thought the protagnist was depressed but that turned out to be false. This was in line with camus' 
            philosophy of absurdism although this work was more inclined towards the nihilism of this character.
