            <u>The Stranger by Albert Camus:</u><br>
            This is among Camus' earliest work. It was not like anything that I had read before.
            The protagnist was a nihilist and didn't have any motivation to do anything and didn't care for anything.
            At first I thought the protagnist was depressed but that turned out to be false. This was in line with camus' 
            philosophy of absurdism although this work was more inclined towards the nihilism of this character.
