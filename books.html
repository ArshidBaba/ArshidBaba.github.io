        <p><b>I am gonna list the books that I finished in this year and not the ones that I have read before</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <li>
            <u>Animal Farm by George Orwell:</u><br>
            This book was funny as well as deep. My brother told me that it was drawing parallels with russian 
            revolution. I also think that it was about how power corrupts the soul. It was either way a good read.

            <u>Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman:</u><br>
            I have been wanting to learn physics really deeply and my head I have already started the journey. 
            I need to finish some unfinished business first then I will learn as much as possible. With this book I learned 
            the general picture of physics. Even though I had read some popular physics books before with this I decided I 
            will go into physics formally or unformally. This book has 6 chapters and it starts from atoms and reaches to 
            gravitation in the 5th and finishes with quantum mechanics. I really enjoyed this book a lot

            <u>The Stranger by Albert Camus:</u><br>
            This is among Camus' earliest work. It was not like anything that I had read before.
            The protagnist was a nihilist and didn't have any motivation to do anything and didn't care for anything.
            At first I thought the protagnist was depressed but that turned out to be false. This was in line with camus' 
            philosophy of absurdism although this work was more inclined towards the nihilism of this character.
