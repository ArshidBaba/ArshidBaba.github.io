        <h3><a href="Syllabus.html">Syllabus is here</a></h3>
        <p>I am studying operating systems for JRF right now. I haven't yet reached to the problem solving stage as I am still into the jargon and concepts learning phase. But I think I have to study faster.
        </p>
        <p>Still going slower than I should go but little progress is none the less progress.</p>
        <p>I decided not to study from a single resource. I am gonna study from a mix of video lectures, online MCQ's and Textbook</p>
        <p>I think the idea of learning from mixed resources was really good even though I spend less   time with it I feel more gets done. Video lectures especially helped.</p>
        <p>I didn't get anything done today. First I wasn't feeling good and second. I woke up late and then in the evening Hadi came so I was chatting with him. Hopefully tomorrow I will try to to push more.</p>
        <p>Today I practiced more problems on CPU scheduling algorithms. I thought I would finish it today but I couldn't. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Today I finished practicing problems on CPU scheduling algorithms. Hopefully tomorrow I will move to Synchronization and semaphores.</p>
        <p>Today I started Process Synchronization and didn't get much further along. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Today I learned a little more about why we need process scheduling but again didn't get much further. Hopefully tomorrow onwards I will move will full throttle.</p>
        <p>Today I learned about semaphores which are tools with which we achieve process synchronization.I learned about counting and binary semaphores. Hopefully tomorrow I will do problems on them.</p>
        <p>Solved a few recurrences in Algorithms and got a better intuition how it works. Still a long way to go. Tomorrow I will work harder.</p>
        <p>I didn't study anything in O.S today. I feel like I got bored with the routine so I need to mix things up. I studied recurrences in algorithms instead.</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>I started today after a long time and with a new strategy and material plus the old material. I feel if I stay consistent I will crack the JRF.</p>
=======
        <p>After 20 days of break today I started studying for JRF again. This break was due to the snowfall, and the Internet shotage caused because of that. I think I damaged the progress. I need to make up for the lost time and go in full speed especially if I am going for a teaching job in the March.</p>
        <p>Today I did a little better than yesterday. I finished my daily quota and a little more. I decided to give JRF the highest priority, higher than TCS, art, math ir even reading. I need to qualify it at any cost.</p>
