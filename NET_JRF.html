        <p>I am studying operating systems for JRF right now. I haven't yet reached to the problem solving stage as I am still into the jargon and concepts learning phase. But I think I have to study faster.
        </p>
        <p>Still going slower than I should go but little progress is none the less progress.</p>
        <p>I decided not to study from a single resource. I am gonna study from a mix of video lectures, online MCQ's and Textbook</p>
        <p>I think the idea of learning from mixed resources was really good even though I spend less   time with it I feel more gets done. Video lectures especially helped.</p>
        <p>I didn't get anything done today. First I wasn't feeling good and second. I woke up late and then in the evening Hadi came so I was chatting with him. Hopefully tomorrow I will try to to push more.</p>
        <p>Today I practiced more problems on CPU scheduling algorithms. I thought I would finish it today but I couldn't. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>
