  <a name="Email_Sending_App"><h1>Email Sending App</h1></a>
  <hr>
  <p>In order to practice making asynchronous tasks with Django, I made a simple app which sends an email to the specified email ids. This task is run seperately by Celery using Redis as a broker. The functionality of this app would be incorporated with the BookCenter app.</p>

  <a name="Celery"><h1>Celery with Django</h1></a>
  <hr>
  <p>In production environment the tasks that take longer to execute are supposed to run seperately so that we can achieve maximum throughput on requests and responses. For Django with <a href="https://celery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html">Celery</a>. Celery is a task queue which helps us run longer running code asynchronously. It used Redis or RabbitMQ as the task broker. I used Celery to send an email from the backend because sending an email is also a time consuming task so we delegate it to Celery. I made it work quickly in my local environment but it was giving me trouble in production. I was deploying my app to Heroku and Celery wasn't executong properly.</p> 
  <a name="RESTful_APIs"><h1>RESTful APIs in Django</h1></a>
  <hr>
  <p>I started making RESTful APIs and I use <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django Rest Framework</a> for that. One can make a rest api in plan Django but that would require a lot of effort and DRF provied other features which plane Django does not. DRF work on top of Django. Django treats it as another installed app. DRF provides Serializers, Routers to do the basic restful stuff. I still have to learn a lot about this framework but I think I am getting a hang of it.</p> 
  <a name="Heroku_Deployment"><h1>Heroku Deployment</h1></a>
  <hr>
  <p>I had never deployed a website before so my first deployment platform is <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. I found many things of ease and struggled with many other things. I noticed one thing is that heroku allocates resources which usually are provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> for example the Redis cache I used for asynchronouus tasks was actually an amazon ec2 instance and it turned out the Heroku is hosted on AWS.</p> 
  <p>Heroku uses the concept of dynos.</p>
  <a name="Django_Framework"><h1>Django Framework</h1></a>   
  <hr>   
  <p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>   is a Python framework used for web development. I picked up Django framework in ending 2018. In 2019 I didn't do anything with it. However I picked it up again this year. I think now I have a better understanding of the whole framework. In production however, people do not use Django templates for the front end. They instead make RESTful APIs which then could communicate with any outter source. Django has components like Models, Views, Templates and URLs.</p>

  <p>
    I have only used Django for development so I do not have anything to compare it to. Django is a giant framework i.e. it does a lot of heavy lifting for you. At first it made me a little uncomfortable but now I think I have a better understanding of it. I will keep using Django and getting better at it because my current job requires for me to work in it.
