        <h1 class="heading">Learning Spring Boot Development</h1>
    </a>
    <hr>

    <p>I decided to learn Spring Boot. I was torn between Node.js and Spring Boot and then I figured it I already know
        Java and don't know much JavaScript so Spring Boot would be an easier and quicker choice. It is my second day
        and I didn't find it that hard as many people have hyped it to be. I learned the Enities, Repositories,
        Services, Controllers and Implementation classes. It certainly has more layers than Django but I still think
        that Django is more hard for a Beginner to learn compared to Spring Boot.</p>

    <p>I developed a simple web service today in Spring Boot. I still have to learn more about Inversion of Control and
        how to do proper database modelling. I was thinking to go with MongoDB with this one. I think I will use Spring
        Boot and MongoDBfor the new backend that I am going to design for the Travel Itenirary. It is going to be
        challenging but I will learn something new.</p>
